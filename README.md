- 👋 Hi, I’m @ms801525
- 👀 I’m interested in Web development, I love to code although I have a bad habit of not being consistent with coding on a regular basis
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in iXperience, which is an online bootcamp, I figured why not enhance my grey area and help make it easier on myself to land a job?
- 💞️ I graduated from Dalhousie with a degree in Applied Computer Science, It is a big accomplishment and I look forwarf to what is next in my career
- 📫 How to reach me: Email: Ms801525@dal.ca
